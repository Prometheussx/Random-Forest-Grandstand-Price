# Predicting Prices with Random Forest Regression

This Python script employs Random Forest Regression to predict prices based on 'Grandstand Level.' It provides flexible and accurate results. The code uses the RandomForestRegressor from the scikit-learn library with 100 estimators for robustness. The `random_state` parameter ensures reproducibility in the results.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Place your data in a CSV file, following the format in the provided example (data.csv).
3. Run the script to predict prices for different 'Grandstand Levels.'
4. View the visualization of the predictions for better insights.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Example

Using the dataset provided in data.csv, the script predicts the price for a 'Grandstand Level' of 7.5, 3.5, 10.5 and yields a price estimate of 28.
